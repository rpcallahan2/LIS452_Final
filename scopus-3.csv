It is the world's seventeenth-largest economy and has used its geostrategic position and active diplomacy to assume membership in the UN Security Council for the first time in almost 50 years, to become a member of the G20 and to take on a visible role in international disputes. But it faces daunting obstacles at home and abroad, the two most important being the Kurdish problem and the state of civil-military relations. How the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) handles these two challenges will determine whether the current improvement in the Turkish political economy proves to be fleeting. Turkey is at an inflection moment. If it can resolve these problems it will find that many of the obstacles to European membership a.nd continuing development will rapidly recede. Failure will mean a return to nationalist and autarchic policies as well as continual violence and instability."
"Lives and statistics: Are 90% of war victims civilians?",26,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77953473395&doi=10.1080%2f00396338.2010.494880&partnerID=40&md5=b995b380ca22fcf917f772d663a2be43","It has become a commonplace to say that war has changed radically since the early twentieth century to the point where civilians now comprise some 80 or 90% of war victims. This proposition has been supported by many writers and academics, some United Nations agencies, and the European Union in its European Security Strategy. Yet it rests on shaky foundations. It is possible that in some particular conflicts nine out of ten deaths are of civilians, but the proposition does not hold up as a generalisation about all war in the past two decades. There is persuasive evidence that certain wars have had civilian death tolls far lower than 90%. The proposition, intended to alert the world to the importance of protecting civilians, has probably had the unintended effect of reinforcing cynicism about efforts to limit the human costs of war."

Bush was president, Washington and the Vatican were in agreement on most 'culture of life' issues and at odds over the war in Iraq. With the 2008 election of Barack Obama, the set of agreements and disagreements has been reversed. There is now substantial common ground on foreign policy, immigration and fighting poverty, but none on gay rights, stem-cell research or abortion. But the Vatican sees Obama as the most secular president in many years. In the Holy See's unofficial view, Obama lacks a religious vision and might prove to be a cultural adversary. But this picture of the new president as ideologically suspect or supportive of moral relativism is false and misleading. To Obama, relativism means putting back together a fragmented American society, and promoting unity in diversity. Being a relativist is not a handicap but an opportunity: a necessary tool for exercising leadership. This has required a revolutionary rethinking of the Vatican's approach to the White House. The relationship has been transformed from an ideological alliance into a pragmatic one."

Within its region, Iran's policies are shaped by instabilities in neighbouring countries and the Middle East in general, questions of Persian Gulf security, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and various contests for power and resources. Iran's relations with Europe, as well as with Russia, China, India and other actors in Asia, Africa and Latin America, have long been shaped by economic interests on the one hand and, particularly in the case of Europe, political differences on the other, in addition to the growing influence of the nuclear conflict. Iran's bilateral relations with the United States are themselves far more intricate than they sometimes appear. Commentators trying to find a single doctrine or underlying driver to explain Iran's regional and international policies, as well as its nuclear programme, have traded various possibilities, including Persian imperialism, the export of the revolution, or the religious zeal of Iran's ruling elite. None of these explanations are convincing. Rather, Iran's regional, international and even nuclear policies are driven by a combination of ambition and fear."
"Strategic thoughts for defence planners",15,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77953401845&doi=10.1080%2f00396338.2010.494883&partnerID=40&md5=70ff7a478dc453b38e981d31331218a7","Defence planning attempts the impossible - to meet 'requirements' that can only be known in the light of events that have yet to occur. Ways in which the prospect for defence planning can be improved include (1) distinguishing the most important defence decisions, and getting them right enough; (2) developing a sufficiently flexible planning capability and dynamic military posture; (3) balancing short- and long-term investments; (4) insisting upon education in general strategic theory as a qualification for the practice of strategy; (5) appreciating that a country can afford to spend on security and defence however much it chooses politically so to do; and (6) recognising that, although defence and security are closely related, they are not synonymous."

From the start, however, the deal was tangential to the main issues at stake, and it offered only temporary respite from the growing threat posed by Iran's fissile-material production programmes. Over the course of the winter, the confidence-building advantages foreseen for the deal have been replaced by still more mutual suspicion. The new version of the fuel-swap deal negotiated by the presidents of Brazil, Turkey and Iran in May 2010 is less attractive on non-proliferation grounds, but on balance will be a plus if Iran is willing to export LEU and if it agrees to stop enriching to 20%. Unfortunately, however, the deal is likely to fail over the same disparity in goals that has frustrated all negotiation efforts to date over Iran's nuclear programme. If diplomacy and strong sanctions do not persuade Iran to accept conditions that would protect against nuclear-weapons break-out, there may be other ways to keep the capability latent. But Iran's lack of restraint risks triggering military action."
"Merkel's folly",23,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77953438430&doi=10.1080%2f00396338.2010.494873&partnerID=40&md5=22529d52c1cc08dce322a366b80755a9","German Chancellor Angela Merkel's policy toward Greece's fiscal crisis, as it developed from late 2009 to April 2010, was folly in many senses of the term. It failed to anticipate the speed with which, and the extent to which, the crisis would spread. It cost much more than immediate support to Greece through its painful fiscal consolidation would have cost. And it reinforced stereotypes and prejudices that obscure the true weakness at the heart of the European Union and its single currency. But while the measures taken in early May may calm the markets temporarily they will not solve the underlying problem. So long as countries in the eurozone can borrow without market sanction, politicians will find a way to dig themselves unsustainably into debt. Threatening them with sanction is no solution either. The best way forward is to place restrictions on access to credit rather than trying to control the build-up of debt."

This certainly seems to apply to the United States, which is simultaneously the strongest country in the history of the world and the most insecure of today's great powers. The threats it has recently identified in the international system, from Iraq to Hugo Chavez to terrorism, are minor compared to what most states have had to confront throughout history. As states grow in power they usually also become more materially secure; why, then, do they often seem to worry more, often about trivial matters? This essay explores the political psychology of unipolarity. Pathologies arise when irrational forces drive policymaking; presumably better policy results from more rational cost-benefit analyses."

Ankara's new foreign-policy activism has been particularly visible in the Middle East, where Turkey has sought to strengthen ties with its Muslim neighbours, especially Iran and Syria. Relations with Russia have improved as well, especially in the economic field, and Ankara has recently sought to mend fences with Armenia, another long-time adversary. This does not mean, however, that Turkey is turning its back on the West or that 'Econo-Islamism' (a blend of business and religious-political interests) has taken charge in Ankara. Turkey still wants, and needs, strong ties with the United States. But in future Turkey is likely to continue to broaden and diversify its foreign policy and be more hesitant to automatically follow Washington's lead Managing the US-Turkish relationship will require patience and skilful diplomacy on both sides, more so now than ever before."

It is behind schedule, under-staffed, under attack and battered by some less-than-cooperative international partners. Critics of the administration have dominated the domestic public debate. But after a year of analysis, discussion and speeches, the Obama administration has reached internal consensus, lined up its nuclear initiatives, and begun organising its congressional supporters. The Obama team is finally ready to take the field. The new strategy will roll out in a tight sequence of reports, events, hearings and votes over the first half of 2010.

But in remembering the egregious mistakes of its predecessor the administration should not claim victory as it exits. It should not, as Vice President Joe Biden did in the midst of the de-Ba'athification crisis, claim all is well in Baghdad. A more honest and realistic approach would recognise the impossible legacy left by the Bush administration. The damage the previous administration did so much to encourage would then be minimised with the help of US allies and multilateral organisations. In short, after seven years of American occupation, it is time to go home."

The 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings are often held up as the archetype of an independent local cell at work, and the perpetrators depicted as self-recruited, leaderless terrorists. Six years after the blasts, however, new evidence connecting some of the most notorious members of the Madrid bombing network with al-Qaeda's senior leadership, along with features of the terrorist network itself and distinctive elements of the likely strategy behind the blasts, suggest that these assumptions are misleading. Judicial documentation now fully accessible at Spain's National Court and other relevant primary or secondary sources can help us better understand what the attacks can tell us about al-Qaeda and a global terrorism in transition, as well as about the changing nature of the threat to open societies."

Meaningful progress will probably require a larger deal in which there are trade-off between US concessions on issues of interest to Russia and Russian concessions on tactical nuclear weapons. Two options merit serious consideration. The first entails the withdrawal of the small number of US tactical weapons that remain in Europe to jump-start a dialogue. The second option involves a package deal that would include Russian agreement to initiate negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons reductions in exchange for NATO agreement to discuss changes in the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.

Nonetheless, there have been noted improvements since 2001, and throughout 2009 Islamabad has demonstrated increasing resolve to defeat militants challenging the writ of the state. Earlier operations such as Al Mizan revealed serious deficiencies in the ability to conduct cordon-and-search operations and to hold territory. In the later operations in Bajaur and Swat, however, the Frontier Corps and army forces showed an improved capability to clear territory and integrate operations with local tribes. But Pakistani doctrine remains inconsistent with recent population-centric innovations in counter-insurgency warfare.

In recent years that relationship has become closer due to a narrative presenting Georgia as a democratic beacon and key strategic country in the region. However, this narrative is beginning to give way to an alternate narrative which suggests that Georgia is governed by an impulsive leader with authoritarian tendencies who was far too close to the Bush administration. While both of these narratives draw on elements of truth, they also lack any nuance or shades of grey.

China's economic development and geopolitical objectives pose the most important, but by no means the only, threat to human security and regional stability. To varying degrees countries in the region are also pursuing short-sighted, environmentally unsustainable development policies, sometimes in conjunction with Chinese ambitions for regional economic integration. To avoid the perils of peace in the Mekong basin, the larger powers in the region, inter-governmental organisations, aid donors and the United States all have critical roles. In particular, cooperative and equitable involvement by China and Thailand is critical, and is an area where Washington may have considerable leverage. Non-governmental organisations, development banks and international agencies should be encouraged to pursue new methods and tools to apprise leaders in Yunnan and Beijing (and, to a lesser extent, Bangkok) of the very real risk of policy blowback from their plans for the Mekong."

Even if there is a dramatic deterioration of relations with Russia or a nuclear Iran triggers a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, it would be difficult to legitimise the modernisation of nuclear delivery systems operated by Europeans in addition to US strategic nuclear forces. In the short term, NATO should not unilaterally withdraw US nuclear weapons from Europe.

Today, the promise these arrangements once held now seems distant. For both sides, relations are now marked by a sense of grievance, disappointment and dashed expectations. The new administration of President Barack Obama sees the repair of the relationship with Russia as a major foreign-policy objective, and is ambitiously attempting to reset it and place it on a more positive footing. Already this new policy has provoked a chorus of condemnation that the United States is appeasing Russia and sacrificing both its national interests and the interests of democratic allies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet region.

The war in Afghanistan rests on the assumption that the 'special relationship' with the United States remains the central pillar of defence thinking. Another assumption is that major inter-state war is unlikely. Such an expectation suggests that deterrence continues to play an important if under-recognised role. Britain remains ready to use war to pursue its policy goals, but the wars in which it has engaged since 1982 have been limited. Defence reviews should be conducted regularly, as in the United States. Moreover, the creation of defence policy needs to be more central to party political debate, not least so that the electorate is more directly engaged in and informed about the issues."

The government has lost the support of many ranking Islamist figures, whose continued backing is necessary to maintain its coherence and effectiveness, and its legitimacy has been eroded. If it fails to modify its authoritarian Islamist mindset and power structure to claw back some, if not all, of its lost clerical and public support, the scene is set for a greater popular backlash in the long run. The current turmoil, ostensibly sparked by the election results, stems from a confluence of factors, including growing public discontent with the regime's theocratic behaviour, economic mismanagement and foreign-policy embarrassments, especially since Ahmadinejad became president in 2005.

The principal instruments of this policy are more American troops with better force protection (a customised version of the counter-insurgency 'surge' employed with ostensible success in Iraq) and firmer bilateral diplomacy with Pakistan. The administration's policy appears to be overdetermined.1The premise of the policy is that the United States must 'own' Afghanistan in order to defend its strategic interests.

Political and ideological differences between parties and even between ministries are becoming more pronounced, not less. This trend narrows the room for manoeuvre and limits the strategic debate. Greater instability in Kunduz province, at the heart of Germany's area of regional responsibility in Afghanistan, has two immediate effects: it both increases the need to act decisively and it heightens the risk of political paralysis in Berlin. This article argues that the latter is likely to prevail."

Or should we keep on spending money to build forces suited to the kind of large-scale, conventional wars which characterised the last century? Australia has been no exception to this. Indeed the contest between 's new's and 's old's visions of defence priorities among Australia's small strategic-policy community has been unusually intense."

The war also demonstrated that the US commitment to Europe is still a critical component of European security and cohesion. As the Allies embark on the search for a reinvigorated Russia policy, they will have to rethink the premises of earlier policies. They will also have to confront head-on the differences between the way much of Europe views Russia and how it is perceived in Washington. If they cannot resolve these differences, or at least agree to disagree on some issues, it will be difficult to craft an effective and unified Western policy.

The Alliance's first operation outside the Euro-Atlantic area has revealed a major gap between grand ambitions and actual capability. Central to this problem is the political disunity among NATO's member-states. The Strasbourg-Kehl summit may provide an opportunity to rethink what can most realistically be expected from NATO in terms of its contribution to international peace and security. Here, much can be learnt from the manner in which it has thus far responded to changing strategic circumstances since the Cold War, and the constraints, internal and external, that have impinged on its activities and are likely to continue to do so. The evidence points to a need for NATO to bring its exalted political purposes into closer alignment with its actual military missions and capabilities. The Alliance still has a potentially important role to play, but greater realism is needed both as to its strengths and its weaknesses."

The new White Paper on French Security and Defence, released in June 2008 after months of internal debate, jettisons a number of precepts and policies that have dominated French defence thinking since the mid l960s. The most controversial change announced in the White Book is Sarkozy's decision to allow France to return to NATO's integrated military command, from which General de Gaulle withdrew France in l966. Sarkozy's decision to bring France back into the Alliance's integrated military structure would have significant security benefits both for France and NATO. It removes an important irritant that has hindered good relations between the United States and France and opens up new possibilities for improving US-European cooperation more broadly. Cooperation between NATO and the EU in particular should become easier with France inside NATO's integrated command."

The more intangible third-order socio-political and institutional effects have not been fully appreciated. Only by adding in an accounting of these indirect effects can a full evaluation of global climate change and appropriate responses be made. The scale and scope of remedial actions needs to be commensurate with the problem. Even mitigation strategies well beyond ones that can be imagined now would still leave the world warming for decades. As a result, thinking about the security implications of global warming means thinking about how groups, nations and institutions adapt to the fact of climate change. The climate dimension needs to be integral to all policy considerations from foreign aid, nation building and border controls, to food and energy security, technology transfer and trade policy, international law, and multilateral diplomacy. Not to recognise the climate angle behind a range of critical issues in security policy will put prospective policy actions at risk of failure."

A rejuvenated, reunited Germany is now seeking a more prominent role in international affairs, but its foreign policy is evolving away from the staunch Atlanticism that predominated during the Cold War. Two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany unquestionably sees the United States as a crucial ally, but also sees Russia as an inevitable partner for the stability of the European order. The bottom line for most German leaders is that the isolation of Russia is unacceptable and must be avoided at all costs. It would deprive the West of its few remaining economic levers over Russian policy and leave Europe and the United States with only cruder means of influencing Russian behaviour. Meanwhile, Russian nationalism and even militarism could accelerate. The sense that Germany has become Russia's last strong link with the West only intensifies German concern, driving German leaders to redouble their efforts to maintain good relations."

In geostrategic terms, several regimes that have pursued resource nationalistic policies, sometimes described as use of the 'energy weapon', will have to revisit these policies. With the global economy slowing and commodity demand falling, a sustained period of weaker prices will shift the advantage back to international companies and away from host governments, as international companies can now afford to be more selective about the fiscal terms and regulatory conditions they are willing to accept from host governments. Evidence of this is already clear for producers of base metals and natural gas, and higher-cost oil producers are also beginning to feel the effects. The rapid shift of leverage from producer states to international companies will likely have destabilising effects in several key countries and regions."

Western militaries, having no options but deadly force, are ill-equipped to defeat this strategy. Using deadly force in population centres can alienate the very people whose cooperation forces are trying to earn. To solve this problem, a suite of capabilities that includes sound, light, lasers, mobile phones, and video cameras - a 'continuum of force' - is proposed. In missions ranging from counter-insurgency to peacekeeping to humanitarian intervention, the typical small military unit needs portable, versatile, scalable capabilities to carry out its mission without harming civilians that get in the way. The technologies for these capabilities are at hand but have not been recognised as a solution to this strategic problem. They need high-level attention, integration and funding."

The odd-couple coalition of Djindjic's Democratic Party and the remnants of Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party puts high priority on attaining EU membership. It rejects Kosovo's declaration of independence of February 2008, but it has renounced any use of force to restore Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo. The new Serbian government finally allowed the EU rule-of-law teams that are advising independent Kosovo to deploy in Serb-majority northern Kosovo in December 2008 and is working with them to squeeze out old ultranationalist party bosses and smugglers. Its actions suggest a fallback of seeking de facto partition of northern Kosovo from Albanian-majority heartland Kosovo. Belgrade is barred from EU membership until find finds and arrests Ratko Mladic, commander of Serb troops at the Srebrenica massacre of almost 8,000 unarmed Bosniak men and boys in 1995."

Successful coalitions with other groups (like ethnic lobbies and humanitarian NGOs) and a receptive Bush administration have helped them gain unprecedented influence in US foreign policy towards the less developed world. Their influence in Washington's Africa policy (especially in relation to Sudan and foreign aid) is probably much deeper, more consistent and more able to survive a change of administration than the evangelical impact on any other area of US external relations."

Early indications suggest that the region may be optimising these rewards with greater prudence than during past oil booms, by reducing debt, increasing savings and launching meaningful economic reforms. Still, it is hardly certain that mounting revenues will enable the region to successfully overcome the political and economic vulnerabilities inherent in oil-led development. The oil boom has neither saved nor doomed the Middle East, but rather opened new possibilities and heightened existing problems. International interest in ensuring the free flow of energy resources should prompt serious efforts by Washington and other capitals to enhance regional integration, encourage meaningful reform and promote long-term cooperation in cultivating a more stable, prosperous and sustainable future for the Middle East."

Presidential personality clearly influences the sort of decision-making process each incumbent feels comfortable with: whether he prefers oral or written interactions, has an appetite for detail, or can tolerate conflict among and with subordinates. A review of the personal styles of five American presidents reveals three broad approaches that can be categorised as 'formalistic', 'competitive' and 'collegial'. The first approach, often associated with President Dwight D. Eisenhower, emphasises order and hierarchy. The second, epitomised by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, seeks wisdom through the clash of ideas among competing subordinates. The third, identified with George H.W.

But we ignore them at our peril: about one billion people live in fragile states, including a disproportionate number of the world's extreme poor, and they account for most of today's wars. These situations require a different framework of building security, legitimacy, governance, and the economy. Only by securing development - bringing security and development together to smooth the transition from conflict to peace and then to embed stability so that development can take hold - can we put down roots deep enough to break the cycle of fragility and violence. Currently, we face critical gaps in our international capabilities to secure development. We need to better integrate military, political, legal, developmental, financial and technical tools with a variety of actors, from states to international organisations, civil society, and the private sector. Beyond assistance, we need new networked relationships between peacekeeping forces and development practitioners, and a new approach to security, to help the people in fragile states shift from being victims to principal agents of recovery."

Arguments and approaches based in economic or cultural determinism, or even conspiracy theory, were adduced to explain the exceptional condition of the Arab world: Western schemes for domination, oil, Islam or simply 'the Arab mind'. Instead of resorting to such essentialism, we should rather attempt to uncover forces that improve or decrease the chances for political reform or democratisation in the Arab states and Iran. Though outside powers cannot successfully engage in social and political engineering in the states of the region, Western actors can decide whether they want to make life more difficult for their actual and potential partners in the region by making them the object of their policies, or whether they want to make their task easier through credible political, societal and economical engagement."

In particular, the emergence of a more assertive China does not mean a more aggressive China or that war in Asia is more likely. While Beijing may be increasingly pushing its own agenda in regional international affairs, and while it may seek to displace the United States as the regional hegemon, this does not automatically translate into an expansionist China. If anything, China appears content to press its claims peacefully, if forcefully, through existing avenues and institutions of international relations, and in particular by co-opting these avenues and institutions to meet its own purposes. Secondly, when one looks more closely at the Chinese military buildup, one can still find many deficiencies in its offensive capabilities. The Chinese war machine, while still quite worrisome, may not be quite as threatening as some might argue."

But East Asia's stable order is based on a unique and remarkable triangular relationship among the region's three biggest powers, and that relationship is now under pressure from China's growth. Asia's future peace will depend on the ability of the United States, China and Japan - and eventually India - to create a new regional order which reflects the emerging economic and power relativities of the Asian Century. Creating a stable new order will require major sacrifices from all three powers: America will have to concede primacy and learn to treat China and Japan as equals; China will have to forgo its own dreams of primacy and accept Japan as a legitimate major power; and Japan will have to accept the costs and complexities of strategic independence.

Further, he must decide soon how much permanent US military presence to retain in and near the Persian Gulf and assess how much the American people will support open-ended US engagements in the Greater Middle East. Obama will clearly press for more European support, especially in Afghanistan. He should also foster a new regional security structure, in time involving all Middle East states. It should include confidence-building measures, Standing Military and Political Commissions, incidents at sea and freedom of navigation agreements, 'open skies', and OSCE-like cooperation.

The danger for both US policymakers and the long-suffering Iraqi people is that American politics will continue to shape Iraq policy well beyond the next US presidential election on 4 November 2008. While both candidates have presented starkly different plans for Iraq, those seeking to influence the political and military strategy of the next US president have been held hostage by domestic party concerns. The hazard for the next president is that his Iraq policy will owe much more to bitter and ideologically driven arguments in Washington than the actual situation in Baghdad.

Blame for this is most often assigned to President George W. Bush, but greater responsibility rests with deeper changes in the international system: the resentment (and fear) caused by the preponderance of American power, the loosening of alliances after the demise of the Soviet Union, a fundamental rethinking of the laws of war and peace in an age of terror, the co-branding of the United States with the forces of modernity and globalisation, and a demographic change that has sidelined the post-Second World War generation with their historical memories of American bravery and generosity. The next US president can start to restore America's image by setting a new tone, adroitly managing the US presence in the Persian Gulf and adopting new policies on climate change, immigration, world trade, and Guantanamo Bay.

A century of history has done much to encourage this view. Americans have trouble realising how revolutionary and threatening their unipolar vision can appear to others. A world system dominated by one superpower is a bold and radical programme. If successful, it would mean, for the first time in modern history, a world without a general balance of power. Pursuing such a goal implies numerous confrontations with other nations. It antagonises both states that fear decline and those that anticipate improvement.

The Georgian leader would have been better off rallying a diplomatic coalition to pressure Moscow. His attack, whether provoked or not, has undermined his international credibility. Now some of his allies in the United States and Europe blame him for igniting a crisis which has cost his nation dearly and lowered the threshold for Russian military intervention in Russia's 'near abroad'. The conflict also became a diplomatic confrontation between Russia and the West. In this test of wills, none of the parties - Georgia, Russia or the West - has emerged as a winner.

During the Cold War this wider purpose was mostly seen as deterring a Soviet conventional invasion of Western Europe; today, this wider purpose is less clear and less defined or constrained by strategic logic. The idea of 'calculated ambiguity' has been used to explain the situation, but it is inadequate.

Yet over the past decade, Washington has come to assume the effective functioning of the system rather than retaining it as an end of American grand strategy. US policymakers do not fully appreciate how a changing international system is eroding the United States' security and its way of life. The overarching strategic challenge facing the United States is to revitalise the international system so that the nation can conserve its strength and power even as the global environment shifts. It demands a strategy of conservation.

However, the model of an Iraq divided into three ethno-sectarian entities lacks historical resonance and is likely to increase instability in Iraq rather than reduce it. The most persistent trend in Iraqi history since medieval times is the status of Baghdad as a regional proto-capital for an area from the Gulf to the mountains north of Mosul - an area which was frequently referred to by its inhabitants as 'Iraq' from pre-modern times.

The surprising fact is that land-attack cruise missiles, not ballistic missiles, constitute the primary problem, yet ballistic missiles, and defences against them, command virtually the exclusive attention of decision-makers. Perversely, the United States' quest to sell ballistic-missile defences may be hastening cruise-missile proliferation. Knowing that defences are not nearly as effective against cruise missiles as they are against ballistic missiles, several states have turned to the former to complement the latter. Others, frustrated with the high cost of ballistic-missile defence, have turned to cheaper cruise missiles linked to pre-emptive strike doctrines. In either case, absent policy adjustments, the unintended by-product is likely to be regional arms races and crisis instability."

The greatest challenges faced by the EU are not in the efficacious employment of armed force, but rather in formulating and applying the broader political-military strategy which must underlie it. Outside of Europe, the most efficient way for European governments to contribute to international peace operations will be to assign national contingents directly to UN peacekeeping missions. It is, thus, time for European governments, militaries and populations to get over the trauma of Srebrenica and related UN failures in the Balkans in the early 1990s, take on board the subsequent improvement in the UN's performance, and begin once again to do their share in manning, as they are already doing in paying for, these efforts."

While state weakness and destabilising internal conflicts are a more likely outcome than inter-state war, climate change will be a stress multiplier for all nations and societies, especially those already at risk from ethnic and religious conflicts, economic weakness and environmental degradation. Prudence and sensible risk management suggest that policymakers need to take this issue far more seriously. And strategic planners ought to include worst-case climate-change scenarios in their contingency planning, as climate change is set to rank with terrorism, pandemic diseases and major war as one of the principle challenges to security in the twenty-first century."

Yet, over the past several years, public wealth, public investment, and public enterprise have made a remarkable comeback. An era of state capitalism has dawned, the natural by-product of a global economy which will increasingly depend for most of its growth on China, the Persian Gulf states, and other emerging market countries, many of which are predisposed toward statist models of economic development. This trend is generating plenty of anxiety, particularly among American and European policymakers, who fear that the growth of national oil companies, state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds threatens their countries' economic well-being and national security."

Yet the regime's imaginative interventions in foreign affairs contrast starkly with its immobility in the face of deepening divisions at home. To minimise the perceived threat from Shi'ites in Iran, Iraq and Lebanon, the most sensible course is not to pursue a tacit anti-Shia alliance with the United States and Israel, but rather to improve social and political conditions for Shi'ites at home. This would require confronting the Wahhabi clerical establishment head on, which could fatally undermine one of the pillars of al-Saud rule. The regime appears fated to opt for continued immobility, engaging in largely symbolic regional diplomacy in the hope that this will some how buy it credit at home."

The next American president should build on Bill Clinton's signing of that treaty, as well as George W. Bush's tacit compliance with its strictures, and send it to the US Senate for ratification. It makes sense whether Iran tests its own nuclear weapon in the coming years or not; either way, Washington will need more capacity to apply more pressure on states like Iran, and the treaty could help it garner international support for such pressure. American ratification of the treaty might also be part of a deal by which India and Pakistan agree not to do more testing themselves, joining the United States in a pledge of future restraint."

Major war is the preferred vehicle for the development of strategy, as the issues are absolute, the role of contingency diminished and the play of policy less overt. But a phenomenon increasingly remote from the actual experience of war does not provide a sufficient template for the current debate on strategy. The result is a discussion in flux, without unifying themes or coherence. The labels we currently attach to lesser wars, such as low-intensity operations, irregular war or counter-insurgency warfare, define themselves by their means, not their ends. Governments talk about major war but provide the means only for small war. Having set out with political goals that were unrealisable, they have not adjusted those goals but focused on military solutions which lack a political end. So the application of military capabilities becomes, by default, an end in itself."

The current crises with Iran and North Korea are playing out against the backdrop of the contrasting non-proliferation precedents set in 2003 - in Iraq, through a change of regime, and, in Libya, through change within a regime. Washington has sent mixed messages to Tehran and Pyongyang whether the US objective is regime change or behaviour change. Coercive diplomacy, combining credible inducements and penalties to roll back their nuclear programmes, is not possible when the goal is the maximalist one of regime change. But even if the United States clarifies its objective, negotiations with North Korea and Iran can realistically aim only to narrow, but not to eliminate, the ambiguity. A strategy of containment, whose key elements are deterrence and reassurance, offers the best approach for narrowing and hedging against these states' nuclear ambiguity."

A thorough study of contemporary conflict in historical perspective is needed to correct flawed thinking about the character of conflict, help define future challenges to international security, and build military and civilian governmental capabilities to meet those challenges. Recent and ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and southern Lebanon reveal that military campaigns must be subordinate to a larger strategy that integrates political, military, diplomatic, economic and strategic communication efforts. Military forces must abandon the illusion that technology can solve the problem of future conflict. Leaders should also abandon the belief that wars can be waged efficiently with a minimalist approach to the commitment of forces and other resources."

Insurgencies, like most wars, end in political settlements; indeed most insurgencies have been ended by political settlements. The ability to shape or cajole such settlements out of military victory has never been a strength of the United States' political-military diplomacy. A UN-led effort with an excellent leader and negotiator and the support of key regional and world players will require something close to a revolutionary change in the current outlook; first by the United States and the Iraqi leadership, but also by the UN and the regional and world players."

Most of the region, however, suffers from the opposite problem: states with relatively short histories as independent entities have consolidated their hold on territory and citizens by developing strong security institutions that have proven loyal to incumbent regimes and thwarted prospects for social, economic and political change.

In 2006 it held successful elections, and appears, albeit haltingly, on the road to long-term stability. The progress achieved owes a good deal to the cooperative nation-building efforts of the United Nations and the European Union. The EU has given the UN's long-standing mission critical military support and engaged deeply in economic, humanitarian and democratisation projects. This military strategy of 'punctuated' intervention has allowed EU governments to avoid a costly long-term commitment of troops while capitalising on the marginal value of Europe's highly capable forces when necessary."

Some of Turkey's foreign-policy options involve reducing its reliance on the United States, or even turning away from Washington and deepening ties with America's competitors. Accompanying Turkish discussions about a new strategic orientation has been the growth of a deep anti-Western, and specifically anti-American, mood - one that now shapes the thinking of Turks, regardless of political persuasion. Talk of strategic recalculation might simply be empty rhetoric from a Turkey that is angry and wants Washington to notice, but the wisest course would be to take steps to ensure the continued vitality of an alliance that both Ankara and Washington need to deal effectively with unfamiliar dangers. America's preoccupation with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Turkey's anger over American policies should not obscure this larger picture."

Diminishing the extremism of contemporary Islamic discourse requires attention to the basic 'software' of education. It was not religion in schoolbooks that created the present situation, but rather a lack of free debate and serious effort to create modern educational systems founded on ideals of intellectual excellence, administrative accountability and critical thinking.

Diplomacy, though perennially frustrating when it comes to Somalia, appears obligatory. In fact, the situation in Somalia is best viewed as a political opportunity for the United States and European powers to employ conflict resolution to tame Somali Islamists through political co-optation, to disaggregate the global radical Islamic movement and shrink the area of active jihad, and to make headway in the long-term quest to forge a better relationship with Islam and deprive Osama bin Laden and his followers of a new grievance."

But there is growing evidence that a critical part of the solution lies not in Afghanistan, but across the Khyber Pass in Pakistan. Increasing the number of foreign troops or improving the competence of Afghan forces are no longer sufficient. Success requires a difficult political and diplomatic feat: convincing the government of Pakistan to undermine the insurgent sanctuary on its soil. It is time to fundamentally alter America's and Europe's approach toward Pakistan. Policymakers should focus on a much tougher policy that pressures Pakistan to curb public recruitment campaigns for the Taliban, close training camps and arrest key Taliban leaders in Pakistan."

If, as seems likely, UN sanctions and financial pressure do not persuade Tehran to stop its uranium enrichment programme, the United States may turn to military options to try to push back the date by which Iran could have a nuclear weapon. Low confidence that air strikes could delay Iran's weapons programme, however, and the negative consequences that military action would entail should lead policymakers to consider whether the nuclear timeline might be prolonged through negotiation. Accepting the reality of small-scale, intermittent enrichment activity in exchange for tight international inspection access holds some appeal, and the asking price will only rise over time. But legitimising Iran's programme has significant disadvantages, especially without an assurance of swift and severe penalties in the event the deal is broken."

Bush declared a global war on terror, a number of pundits were deeply unhappy. At least the Pentagon has adjusted its language and now defines the West's predicament as a long war. This is better, but still problems remain: is it really a war, and if not, what is it? Who or what is it against? What is it about? How should it be conducted? Whatever we call the conflict, it is likely to be long. The use of armed force offers no short cuts, and unless used with skill and restraint it may do more harm than good. The length of its engagements, when they occur, will be measured, not in days, but in weeks or even months, and will seldom appear conclusive. It will be that most frustrating of conflicts, a war of attrition. Success, when it comes, will do so slowly and incrementally. The military may protest that this is not the kind of war that they joined up to fight, and taxpayers that they see little return for their money. But this is the only war we are likely to get: it is also the only kind of peace."

This is heartening for those who were in the wilderness during the years when Western governments regarded counter-insurgency as a distraction, of interest only to historians. So it is no surprise that some have urged the re-discovery of classical, 'proven' counter-insurgency methods. But today's insurgencies differ significantly - at the level of policy, strategy, operational art and tactical technique - from those of earlier eras. An enormous amount of classical counter-insurgency remains relevant. Indeed, counter-insurgency provides the 'best fit' framework for strategic problems in the 'war on terror'.

But defensively, in terms of protecting liberal society, the Iraq War was not needed; offensively, in terms of extending liberal society, it has been a failure. The human costs have been high, especially in Iraqi lives but also coalition forces, and this has led to a rapid erosion of public support. The experience of Iraq may well result in a reluctance to engage in 'offensive liberal wars'. An alternative course to a policy of active regime change and intervention is something akin to containment. The liberal case for containment is that it is preferable to an illiberal war and, more positively, it ultimately depends on the strength and durability of Western countries. The liberal case against containment is that biding time requires tolerating continuing injustice and tyranny. Containment also depends on allies who are not necessarily liberal in themselves but who happen to be on the target's periphery. The risk here is of commitments to regimes which cause their own instability, from which it is harder to save them than from the threat of external aggression."

The strategy championed three big ideas - offensive action, regime change and preventive war - that put the United States on the road to Baghdad and a fourth, democratisation, that increased Washington's ambitions once it was there. Nearly four painful years later, many of the hopes that accompanied the preventive attack on Iraq have been dashed. Washington now lives with fresh reminders that even a supreme power is not omnipotent and cannot readily bend others to its will. But whatever happens in Iraq, the rogue state-terrorist-proliferation threat is not going to disappear anytime soon, the powerful impetus of 11 September will continue to cast a shadow over the US debate, and consequently the ideas championed by the Bush administration will remain on the agenda. Iraq raises serious questions about the costs and feasibility of these ideas but does not undercut their basic logic."

The problem is that Tehran's hostility has served both its ideological mandates and strategic calculations. There has never been sufficient incentive for the clerical oligarchs to abandon a policy whose costs in terms of US sanctions and criticism seemed bearable. Given the current consolidation of conservative power within Iran and the collapse of diplomatic efforts to ensure a viable Israeli-Palestinian peace, Iran's policy is unlikely to change noticeably. Hizbullah's apparent triumph only strengthens the hands of Iranian hardliners pressing for confrontation with the Jewish state. In the end, the best manner of extracting Iran from the Arab-Israeli arena is for the United States and the key Arab states to launch a concerted diplomatic effort to resolve the remaining differences between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In the meantime, a determined effort to rebuild Lebanon and strengthen the central government in Beirut may in time diminish Hizbullah's influence. Such a development would not just diminish Iran's radicalism, but would remove a series of corrosive disputes that have done much to undermine the stability of the Middle East."

They have proven thoroughly incapable of preventing an impoverished, dysfunctional country from consistently endangering the peace and stability of the world's most economically dynamic region. This has been nothing less than a collective failure.

The army, which is carrying the principal load among the military services, has embraced counter-insurgency as one of its primary missions. These changes reflect the military's ability to adapt to the changing battlefield. They are intended not only to guide the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also future operations in the long war against violent Islamic extremists. The new emphasis on counter-insurgency, however, is largely disconnected from the Defense Department's previously established spending priorities and personnel policy. The result is that American defence is in a state of strategic confusion. There are not enough forces to effectively carry out counter-insurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while maintaining a strategic reserve for other threats. To fully exploit the long overdue emphasis on counterinsurgency, maintain sufficient forces for dealing with unanticipated contingencies and bring coherence to American defence strategy, the Pentagon needs to increase the United States' ground forces."

For all of its importance, however, recognition of uncertainty poses a dilemma for strategists: in predicting the future, they are likely to be wrong; but in resisting prediction, they risk clouding the rational bases for making strategic choices. Overconfidence in prediction may lead to good preparation for the wrong future, but wholesale dismissal of prediction may lead a strategist to spread his resources too thinly. In pursuit of flexibility, he ends up well prepared for nothing. A natural compromise is to build strategies that are robust across multiple alternative future events but are still tailored to meet the challenges of the most likely future events. Recent US national security strategy has veered from this middle course and placed too much emphasis on the role of uncertainty. A more balanced approach would address a wide range of potential threats and security challenges, but would also incorporate explicit, transparent, probabilistic reasoning into planning processes. The main benefit of such an approach would not necessarily be more precise predictions of the future, but rather greater clarity and discipline applied to the difficult judgements about the future upon which strategy depends."

Depending on assumptions about technical variables, the earliest Iran might be able to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon is assessed to fall between the end of 2008 and 2010, a range that might be said to be within the margin of error, given the unknowns about the programme and the inspectors' sharply decreased access.

Militia disarmament thus failed in Iraq. The failure to apply lessons from the past was compounded by the fact that demobilisation was attempted in a situation where no group fully accepted either the occupation government or the nascent Iraqi state. This failure allowed Iraqi security institutions to be infected by paramilitary groups, heightening the extent of civil conflict."

Detention without trial, arbitrary arrest, disappearance, torture and the like soon result once a political authority decides to describe a conflict in which it is involved as 'war'. National or regime security takes centre stage, security ideologies play a stronger role, and the means employed push at the boundaries of the acceptable. This close association between conflict and human-rights abuse, if no other reason, should make us pause before we too readily resort to the language of war. The Cold War and the current 'global war on terror' - to use the US term - are no exceptions to this general finding. Disappearance, torture and extra-judicial killings have been features of both. The struggle against terrorism has generated a sense of impunity for actions that threaten many different groups."

Yet some policymakers still cling to modernised nuclear weapons for specific tasks in ensuring American security. Since at least 1991, US security has depended almost exclusively on increasingly capable conventional weapons, as effective as nuclear weapons for attacking the most difficult targets. Deterrence through conventional weapons is decisively more credible than through existing or prospective nuclear alternatives. The mere possession of unprecedented conventional military superiority is not enough; a truly effective strategy hinges on perceived effectiveness. Along with addressing conventional needs, America must reformulate its position on nuclear weapons to severely diminish their relevance and solidify the longstanding international taboo against their use."

The threat is both urgent and profound, and it will be necessary to embark on considered long-term strategies which may require European leaders to re-examine some of the tacit arrangements that have allowed European societies to enjoy an unparalleled degree of domestic freedom, peace and prosperity."
"Populist resurgence in Latin America?",1,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33747607001&doi=10.1080%2f00396330600765393&partnerID=40&md5=b2c77fcc1f26a21977d4cf5bfe62aef2","Latin American voters will soon cast ballots in national elections in several countries. Some argue that the region is undergoing a uniform political shift to the left, that mistrust of neo-liberal economics and US foreign policy has united these states in a populist wave of reaction against both, and that this trend will bind these states to countries outside the region, undermining US interests. This generalisation does not withstand country-specific scrutiny. Analysis of the unique political circumstances in each of these states reveals that the populist, anti-American trend is hardly uniform, and that the political and economic ties that bind Latin America and the United States are not so easily undone."

In turn, the advent of Iraq as a field of jihad has prompted jihadists to refine and spread urban warfare techniques. If they choose to apply these techniques robustly to infiltrated cities elsewhere, the extraordinary need for special-operations forces - superseding the Western taboo on using a nation's military forces against its own citizens within its own territory - could arise. The US Department of Defense appears inclined to believe that the application of military power - albeit unconventional military power - will ultimately dictate victory. Such an attitude could lead to the downplaying of paramount non-military aspects of counter-terrorism, to the detriment of national and international security. If the US State Department were armed with a mandate to coordinate national counter-terrorism efforts, diplomatic, political, law-enforcement and intelligence efforts against terrorism would gain momentum and coherence."

Bush administration declared that the United States had adopted a 'pre-emptive' military doctrine to address new threats posed by terrorists and 'rogue states' armed with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. However, the so-called 'Bush Doctrine' met substantial international opposition when it was proposed - and even more resistance when it was applied to the case of Iraq. Subsequent events in Iraq have not made the idea any more popular. It is somewhat startling, then, that numerous states and international organisations seem now to support the call to revise long-held international understandings about when force might be used. A sizable number agree that the risk of calamitous surprise attacks, especially with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, might justify preventive strikes or wars against terrorists or their state sponsors. Anew international norm may thus be under construction, though states continue to disagree about the agents of decision and action."

For Europe, the most important ramification of this proliferation will be to restrain European willingness to intervene militarily beyond the territories of NATO and EU members. With this background, the debate on missile defence is likely to continue on Europe, yet with only a moderate threat perception, tight budgets and other military necessities, missile defences can not be a political priority."

Islam has become an increasingly powerful political force, and some Islamist groups are unquestionably radical and violent, and seek a sharia-based Caliphate uniting the North Caucasus. Their tactics include assassinations, kidnappings, bombings and armed attacks against towns. But there is a bigger issue at stake. Russia has many millions of Muslims, and xenophobic, anti-Muslim organisations and sentiment are increasingly prominent in the Russian political landscape. The spread of the North Caucasus crisis to other Muslim regions, such as Bashkortostan and Tatarstan, could affect Russia's entire political trajectory."

It is on the basis of this trajectory - and because of al-Qaeda's stated aims to acquire and use a so-called 'weapon of mass destruction' - that many analysts have concluded that a nuclear terror attack is likely only a matter of time. Others argue that this is alarmism, but the fissile material is available, or could become available, from a Russian nuclear stockpile that remains dangerously insecure. An improvised nuclear device would be difficult, but not too difficult, to build. And there are terrorist groups that have already demonstrated the technical abilities and organisational reach to make us very worried."

Over the past three decades China's access to offshore sources of energy has never been threatened for political reasons. The webs of interdependence between China and United States and its Asian allies on the one hand, and oil-supplying countries on the other, provide the single most powerful assurance against future disruptions to Chinese oil imports. The more daunting challenge for China is to make energy governance a key element in its conservation programmes. For the rest of the world, the desirable approach is to work with China in order to achieve a managed rise in China's energy consumption."

None of the current efforts to reform the US intelligence community addresses these virtually intractable pedagogical, cultural and organisational challenges. However, there are some possible measures to remedy these weaknesses, at least partially. Emerging information technology, already being adopted by commercial and non-governmental enterprises, has the potential to address key aspects of the structural problems plaguing the intelligence community."

The most problematic border is with Pakistan. Although Islamabad has repeatedly pledged to stop cross-border armed infiltrations and drug trafficking, Kabul strongly believes that Pakistan has not done enough. Unless this long and treacherous border, with a complex history, is secured, it has the potential not only to undermine Afghanistan's transition, but also to imperil regional stability. The sooner this challenge is overcome the better for all parties concerned, and the power that can play a key role in the process is the United States."

A refocus of US strategy is badly needed: Washington needs to exploit natural alliances among countries that have a stake in a stable Middle East. Internationalisation of issues is the best way to help the Persian Gulf region avoid increasing militarisation. Asian leaders are becoming increasingly worried about their economies' growing dependence on Persian Gulf oil and gas and are likely to be receptive to any multi-national initiative that would make supplies from the region more secure or provide a framework for developing alternative energy substitutes. In particular, the United States could greatly benefit from drawing China into the equation as an oil-importer ally rather than focusing on how Beijing could some day be a strategic rival."

Japan's competing pipeline initiative suddenly appeared to become the front-runner in 2004, partly as a consequence of the Kremlin campaign against Yukos. Nevertheless, Russia's current plan represents a cautious strategy to preserve its flexibility and delay the difficult decision.

These operations can be described as law enforcement or human security operations even though they are more robust than policing and may involve the use of military force. Prerequisities for these operations include: the primacy of human rights; legality; appropriate military response; clear political authority; civil, police and military coordination; and adequate intelligence and information.

Mutual frustration with US regional policies and European attitudes has been the main driver of this rapprochement, along with expanding trade and increasing common ground on foreign-policy issues. Turkish-Russian relations have not yet blossomed into a strategic partnership, and suspicions linger after centuries of geopolitical competition, but the United States can no longer rely on Turkey as an automatic counterweight to Russia in regions like the Black Sea and the Caucasus. Together, Turkey and Russia also have the potential to obstruct American policy initiatives in the Middle East. To head off potential problems, Washington will have to address Turkey's concerns about US policy in Iraq."

Yet creating an AU 'capability protect' depends vitally on Western help. It is not enough to increase the supply of African peacekeepers: peacekeeping works when the warring parties are ready for peace, whereas genocide occurs when there is no peace to keep. Besides more peacekeepers, Africa needs a capability for forcible humanitarian intervention. This implies AU forces superior to the forces doing the killing, including those of the complicit regime - a tall order to be sure, but feasible because killing forces usually lack combat capability and are ready to kill but not to fight. To build such a force, the AU should look upon NATO as a model for force planning and force generation, and as a partner ready to assist and stand behind AU forces."

Ukraine's integration into these institutions would dramatically change the political map of Europe and could have a catalytic affect on the region, reinforcing the Western orientation of Georgia and Moldova. It could also have an impact on the prospects for reform in Russia. However, Ukraine's Western integration remains uncertain. Yushchenko's push for the EU and NATO comes at a time when both institutions are facing new challenges and doubts about the wisdom of further enlargement. There are signs, moreover, that the Orange Revolution may be losing momentum. A lot will depend on the outcome of the parliamentary elections in March 2006. A coalition of reformist forces led by President Yushchenko could give Ukraine's push for Western integration new impetus. But a victory by the forces allied with former Prime Minister Victor Yanukovych could be a severe setback for Ukraine's hopes of Western integration."

The deteriorating security environment demonstrates that this strategy has not been successful. The level of troops, police and financial assistance has been among the lowest of any stability operation since the Second World War, and there has been no peace settlement. The US decision to hand control of the volatile southern provinces to NATO has also triggered deep concerns among Afghan leaders about America's long-term commitment, as well as NATO's ability to fight a sustained counter-insurgency campaign. These problems are unfortunate, since they may undermine Afghanistan's success to date in building democracy and improving social and economic conditions."

Failure to sustain efficiency gains after the oil shocks of the 1970s left the country increasingly reliant on imported petroleum. American leaders have neglected the need for international cooperation and a long-term transition to higher efficiency, based on market measures. In order for the United States to reduce its exposure to volatile world oil markets, resource nationalism and the potential for global economic disruptions, America must engage in the hard work of consensus-building and promoting a long-range effort to secure its energy future."

The party most responsible for this course of events is al-Qaeda, with associated Islamic nihilists and Saddam-era henchmen. They have openly declared their intention to ignite civil war by committing gruesome acts of mass murder targeted against Iraq's Shia. Such a strategy is perfectly in tune with the apocalyptic designs of al-Qaeda and the blood thirst of its Iraqi allies. But mainstream Iraqi politicians both in power and in opposition are playing their part in fanning the flames. There are a few courageous and increasingly beleaguered spiritual leaders, public figures, activists and professionals who are refusing to be swept up by the sectarian fever. Among them are some quite powerful figures like Ayatollah Sistani. Attempts at opening up the political process should focus on these leaders rather than trying to match extremists from one community with extremists from the other."

What this actually means remains to be seen, but destabilising consequences, particularly in Serbia, cannot be ruled out.

The international organisations and governments involved in such efforts, however, have neither the doctrine nor organisation for such tasks. Problems encountered in recent efforts signal the need for a unified international counterpart for the recipient national government. Peacebuilding and statebuilding require transitional governance institutions that incorporate the concurrent need for internal and external legitimacy transparently, rather than in a fragmented, secretive and ad hoc way. The peacebuilding mechanisms proposed by the Secretary-General's High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change have the potential to bring order into the anarchy often created by multiple agendas, doctrines and aid budgets."

UK counter-terrorism strategy rests on four campaigns of prevention, pursuit, protection and preparation. This approach needs to be transferred to the international arena to generate a stronger sense of strategic direction in countering al-Qaeda and its associated groups and ideology, while allowing nations to participate in countering terrorism in ways appropriate to their constitutions and circumstances, with results that will be mutually reinforcing. Such strategic orientation will help guard against pressure for short-term measures likely to prove counter-productive in the long term, and improve the effectiveness of public communication to counter the terrorists' own narrative."

The fundamental issue is strategic. It concerns the readiness to acknowledge and adjust to the power of others, however undeserved, illegitimate, inconvenient and awkward this power may be. By and large, the counter-visionaries believe that the visionaries go wrong by always seeking to ignore, circumvent or defeat opponents. This disagreement between visionaries and counter-visionaries is not simply one of Americans versus Europeans, although it has recently turned out that way. While the limits to the ability of Western states to promote political change elsewhere have become apparent, and so the transatlantic disagreement has eased, questions of ideology and legitimacy are still vital, as is evident in the debates about how to deal with China and Iran. In some respects liberal democracies cannot help but provide a strategic vision for those coping with authoritarianism, but the potency of this vision in the end will depend on how well it seems to work at home, and the capacity of the transatlantic states to cope with the domestic as well as the international challenges they face."

Yet unconventional missions, including peacekeeping, counterinsurgency, counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism, are the only kind that NATO or EU forces are likely to be collectively assigned for the foreseeable future. These, then, should be the focus for NATO and EU planning, training and equipping. While the UN is the cheapest, most generally acceptable and often most effective instrument for managing international military interventions, there is an effective ceiling beyond which the UN will not suffice. The UN does not do forced entries, and has never fielded more than about 20,000 troops in any single operation. Where these thresholds must be surpassed, NATO, the EU or an ad hoc coalition will be needed. Afghanistan is the next test for Western collective defence efforts. Success there will require greater EU as well as NATO engagement."

Some states aid terrorist groups by being passive as terrorists operate on their soil. The experiences of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan vis-à-vis al-Qaeda, as well as the US tolerance of Provisional Irish Republican Army activities during the 1970s and 1980s, are instructive. These cases suggest that passive support usually occurs due to strong popular support for a terrorist group's cause, a perceived lack of a direct threat to the regime, and limited costs to the government for tolerating these activities. Halting passive support is difficult and requires new policies and a new way of thinking about the problem of state support for terrorism."

Alternative visions of the international system are abundant, from China's to the American neo-conservatives' to Osama bin Laden's. The vision behind the Truman world order remains the most powerful, and can still be salvaged. But the United States, as in 1945, must provide leadership and develop a new contract between America and the world.

But the use of preventive force - and the debate over its legality and wisdom - predate the Bush administration's post-11 September 2001 strategy. A careful examination of the history, rationale, costs and benefits of using preventive force suggests that, while rare, preventive force has a legitimate role to play in tackling some of the most dangerous security problems facing the United States and the wider international community."

American history shows that the United States has had a strong propensity to become involved in unnecessary wars. These wars share some common characteristics: they were justified in the name of America's presumed historical mission; they were entered into on the basis of false premises; a relatively small 'war party' was indispensable to the decision to go to war; the two-party democratic competition frequently acted as a stimulus to military action; and the wars exhibit a kind of 'law of unintended consequences'."

It was inevitable that it should have suffered from grave shortcomings in management, organisation, staffing, direction and resources. But some of these were avoidable. While governments and the headquarters in Baghdad focussed on high political and constitutional matters and the organisation of large-scale contracts, CPA staff on the ground elsewhere faced very different challenges with which they were ill equipped to deal. The prevailing security environment was the key to all other activity, but there was a close relationship between this and progress over reconstruction, the development of local as well as national government, and the perceptions of the Iraqis."

Uribe's ambitious plan to gain control over lawless territories and provide security to all sectors of society based on an expanded military and police presence and the creation of networks of civilian support has been controversial and has faced particularly fierce censure from human-rights organisations. Yet polemics have obscured some underlying facts about the conflict. It is possible to measure what is going on in terms of violent attacks, armed clashes, deaths and injuries. Such metrics, analysed rigorously, show incomplete but nonetheless unmistakable evidence that the Uribe government has had significant success in fighting the guerrillas while reducing civilian deaths."

The struggle should be presented, not just as a fight against evil or as a defence of freedom, but also as a fight against tragically erroneous ideas. It should be seen as a means of ensuring that the societies from whence terrorism comes do not succumb to endemic violence. It needs to encompass close attention to after-care in societies that have been torn apart by terrorism. An important aim must be the relegation of terrorists to a status of near-irrelevance as long-standing grievances are addressed and peoples can see that a grim terrorist war of attrition is achieving little and damaging their own societies."

The Americans, on the other hand, were sympathetic to the locals, committed to compromise and strong supporters of international law and the United Nations. Now it's the other way around. As case studies from Iran, Iraq, Algeria and Egypt show, the two sides have effectively traded places, as a result of their changing roles in the international system. The fact that Americans are now walking in European footsteps does not mean that they will suffer the same fate as their predecessors. If America can avoid the temptation to act like an imperial power and legitimise its efforts by promoting democracy and winning international support, it might also be able to avoid the resentment and violent resistance that doomed the British and French."

Such situations can result in direct security concerns, including the presence of armed elements within the refugee population and the spill-over of conflict across borders, and indirect security concerns, as tensions rise between local populations and refugees over the allocation of scarce resources. Somali refugees in Kenya and Burundian refugees in Tanzania constitute two of the most challenging protracted refugee situations in Africa. The overall response to protracted refugee situations remains fragmented, compartmentalised and ineffective. What is required is a new policy agenda that extends beyond conventional boundaries and seeks to integrate the resolution of chronic and recurring regional refugee problems with economic development and security issues."

Military and civilian planners were culpable in failing to plan for certain tasks, but the most serious problems had no good solution. Even so, there are lessons to be learned. These include the danger that the imperatives of 'force protection' may sacrifice the broader political mission of US forces and the need for scepticism over the capacity of outsiders to develop the skill and expertise required to reconstruct decapitated states."

It has centralised decision-making, strengthened the Revolutionary Guard, invested in new strategic weapons, built ties of patronage and effectively used economic levers to assert control. The conservatives' consolidation of power now constitutes the framework of Iran's power politics, which will in turn determine the nature and scope of internal political developments after the 2005 presidential elections, the country's response to outside pressures regarding the nuclear issue, and the kind of government which is likely to evolve in the Islamic Republic."

Although there are glimmers of Chinese 'new thinking' about Japan, the history issue, deep societal antipathy and substantial strategic divergences keep the political relationship from progressing the way the bilateral economic relationship has grown. Japan is not likely to re-emerge as a great power or discontinue its alliance with the United States, despite the steady expansion of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Japan - China tensions therefore simmer on, with the risk that a crisis over Taiwan or some other issue will plunge the East Asian giants into a cold war."

Calling the fight against terrorism a 'war' entails some major drawbacks. First, the use of the word 'war' gives unwarranted status and legitimacy to the adversary. Second, it exaggerates the role of military operations in fighting global terrorism. Third, the United States bent both its internal judicial rules and international law to accommodate the concept of war on terror. Fourth, the connection drawn by the Americans between the war on terrorism and the concept of preventive war has worried the United States' partners and undermined the anti-terrorist coalition. Fifth, the linkage with the war against Iraq has aggravated the problem, while heightening anti-Western and anti-American feeling in the Middle East and the Islamic world. Finally, the 'war on terror' has detracted from the consideration of some urgent political problems that fuel Middle East terrorism."

The security risk from expanding nuclear energy programmes could potentially be contained by the commercial provision of nuclear-fuel services. Countries that already possess uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing facilities could guarantee client countries with cradle-to-grave nuclear fuel services. The guarantee, backed by governmental or international entities, could persuade governments to abstain from building their own fuel-cycle facilities. Decisions to reject such an arrangement, which provides direct economic benefit and relieves waste management challenges, would spotlight a government's intentions and invite a coordinated international response. Iran and Brazil present crucial early tests."

This violence escalated demands across Palestinian society that the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat surrender some of his powers and reform a judicial system riddled with inefficiency and corruption.

While Israel enjoys unprecedented military superiority over its enemies, the security of Israelis is at an all-time low, and a nuclear threat, primarily from Iran, is on the rise. This paradoxical situation stems from a failure to adjust Israel's security doctrine to regional, global and technological changes since the mid-1970s. Four major components of this doctrine in particular are inadequate to contemporary challenges: the traditional strategic triumvirate of deterrence, strategic warning and swift battlefield decision; the concept of the Israeli Defense Force as the 'people's army'; Israel's nuclear policy; and the correlation between diplomacy and use of force as a means to reduce threats."

In these terms, Europe's ongoing integration is proceeding apace and of considerable geopolitical consequence. Europe's mounting geopolitical weight, although contributing to the turmoil that has beset Atlantic relations, need not come at the expense of its link to the United States. On the contrary, the emergence of a more unified and muscular Europe has the potential to salvage a transatlantic alliance that is currently strained to the breaking point."

The current enlargement, which concluded in April and May 2004 with the near-simultaneous entry into NATO and the EU of a group of Central European countries, was quite typical. From now on, however, addressing the issue of the foreseeable borders of the enlarged Union (and NATO too, for that matter) is crucial for shaping a credible, coherent and effective menu for action not only in and around Europe itself, but also - hopefully - in the wider world. The central European newcomers can play a crucial role in this process, especially if they actively contribute to formulating policies that may be broadly acceptable to all EU members."

In the aftermath of its early and widely publicised failures in Somalia and Yugoslavia, the UN's reputation for competent nationbuilding was seriously damaged, and demand for its services fell off noticeably. More recently, the US reputation for competence in the field has suffered as a result of setbacks in Afghanistan and Iraq. A new study by the RAND corporation indicates that UN-led operations tended to be smaller, shorter, less expensive and, on average, more successful than those led by the United States. This divergence in performance can be explained in part by the greater inherent difficulty of some of the US-led operations, but is also a product of the UN's greater success in learning from experience."

What Iran will do is likely to depend on the type of relationship it has with the United States, the emerging security architecture in the Persian Gulf and the evolving nature of its domestic politics. As constituencies and alliances shift, and policies and positions alter within the corridors of clerical power, Washington has an opportunity to influence the direction of Iran's nuclear deliberations before decisive steps are taken in the wrong direction. Through a bilateral arrangement involving mutual concessions from both sides, the US could empower those within the clerical estate calling for nuclear restraint.

This is not the position that even a global military hegemon can afford to be in as it confronts terrorist movement with an apocalyptic streak and finds itself in a difficult counter-insurgency battle in Iraq. The re-election of President George W. Bush does not, obviously, offer the kind of fresh start that American allies were hoping for. In the United States itself, the Republicans' convincing electoral win hardly masks the anxiety and recriminations among policy elites and a large minority of the general public. Still, the US and its allies need to find enough common ground to deal realistically with the realities that face them.

Europe pursues its own self-sustaining union of nation states that points towards a pluralist world order that is multipolar, balanced and multilateral. The future of the West, and perhaps of the world, will depend on whether these two visions can accommodate each other sufficiently to establish a harmonious balance. However, without a more coherent and integrated Europe and a revival of American appreciation for constitutional balance, America's imperial fantasies and Europe's constitutional dreams may well defeat each other."

For the first time in history, no major geopolitical conflict divides the powers of the Eurasian mainland. Three new strategic links have arisen - the Sino-Russian strategic partnership; the EU 'Common Strategy towards Russia'; and what the EU and China are explicitly describing as 'strategic' cooperation - built with transparency, little fanfare and no declared common enemy. These developments will undermine the unipolar world that the United States is attempting to construct. At the same time, and quite remarkably, China is being drawn into a continental orientation.

But this new fundamentalism has turned into a costly misadventure. As a grand strategic approach to global leadership, it has failed. It is hard to think of another instance in American diplomatic history where a strategic wrong turn has done so much damage to the country's international position - its prestige, credibility, security partnerships and the goodwill of other countries - in such a short time, with so little to show for it. A single-minded American campaign against terrorism and rogue states in which countries are either 'with us or against us' and bullied into support is not leadership but a geostrategic wrecking ball that will destroy America's own half-century old international architecture.

But the signs are that the Europeans are learning from that failure. A more robust and self-confident EU foreign policy is emerging. The European Convention and its draft Constitution, was an important exercise in self-definition and institutional reform. Many of the proposed reforms - a European Council President, an EU Foreign Minister, a joined-up diplomatic service - should make the EU a more effective international actor. But institutional reforms will have a little effect without a clear sense of purpose. Hence the momentum behind the EU security strategy, sketching out a shared vision on the nature of today's threats and on the appropriate policy responses. The EU's stance on some of the key strategic issues - WMD proliferation, failed states, the rules governing the use of force - will determine whether the EU's new-found assertiveness will endure or degenerate, yet again, into internal divisions and inaction."

In the Iraq crisis, the US and UK asserted a strong legal basis for their resort to force, mamely, existing Security Council resolutions. More generally, both within the Security Council and beyond, a wide variety of grounds for intervention in states has been recognised in international practice. However, attemps to develop doctines of pre-emption and humanitarian intervention have not commanded broad support, since most states still value the non-intervention norm.

The crisis was shaped, above all, by the prism through which the United States views threats to its own and international security after 11 september 2001. Yet neither those threats, which are real and need to be taken seriously, nor the stormy politics of Iraq at the Security Council in 2002 and 2003, should lead to the conclusion that the UN is destined to become irrelevant. That conclusion rests upon a basic misunderstanding of the UN's role in international peace and security. As the harsh realities of rebuilding Iraq become over more apparent, as the long-term costs of the diplomatic debacle in New York in early 2003 filter through, and as the challenges posed by terrorism and the proliferation of WMD remain, interest-based calculations and principle both point to a return to the UN.

Germany made only financial contributions, and hundreds of thousands of Gremans took to the streets to protest against the war. Yet, since, 1991, Germany had come a long way in its attitudes towards military force.

This system is uniquely French, tailored to France's particular threats, capacities and civic culture. Nonetheless, there are lesson from France's experience for other countries, including the United States.

These operations have had to develop a capacity for tackling the problem of media manipulation in societies racked by, or recovering from, massive conflict.

There was little organisational awareness of how to react either to the incendiary uses of media in Rwanda before and during the 1994 genocide, or to the systematic manipulation of public opinion in Bosnia after Dayton.

Over the next several years, North Korea could comptete facilities capable of producing sufficient plutonium and highly enriched uranium for up to a dozen nuclear weapons annually. Options for dealing with this threat are limited. For now, at least, Washington's basic approach seems to be to ignore and downplay the North Korean threat as much as possible, while focusing its energies on Iraq. Once Iraq is out of the way, Washington will face an even greater challenge in overcoming internal divisions and designing an effective strategy to deal with North Korea, where military and political options are more limited and the adversary is more powerful."

But there is also a risk closer to home. The move towards liberalised energy markets in Europe, the US and, to some extent, Asia could undermine both the long-term contracts which have underpinned the funding of big, long-distance gas pipelines, and the building of new nuclear power plants and renewable energy generators. Both are needed to meet the growing environmental requirement for carbon-free energy. Liberalisation does not, or should not, mean an end to all regulation by governments.

Yet these achievements have been overshadowed by growing concerns that the alliance is becoming irrelevant. At the heart of these concerns is a yawning gap in military capabilities between the United States and its European allies. The answer is not to rehash old complaints about European foot-dragging or American drum-beating. Rather, NATO should refocus its stalled Defence Capabilities Initiative (DCI) on using defence transformation to build a small 'Spearhead Response Force', that is, a European force capable of being a lead-element in assertive NATO efforts to cope with new threats. A new defence initiative will make little progress if it merely streamlines the NATO command structure and pursues a compressed list of DCI measures in unfocused ways. There must be a clear concentration on the specific forces to be used for new missions, which must be fully equipped with the necessary capabilities."

The release provoked immediate controversy. Yet supporters of the NPR have oversold its benefits while its critics have exaggerated its dangers. The NPR is neither a transformational nuclear strategy nor a dangerous path to nuclear armageddon. What is striking about the document is not so much the bold new directions that it charts, but its tinkering with policies that it claims to have rejected. This suggests that a great deal of the public and international response has been shaped as much by context as content. In the near-term, the most serious consequences of the NPR are the diplomatic and geopolitical problems it causes for America's standing and image in the world, rather than its direct effects on international security and the prospects for war and peace."

To be sure, weapons-procurement decisions only provide a single case study with respect to alliance relations - hardly a complete view of the political landscape. But neither should transatlantic efforts to shape the defence acquisition environment be dismissed as tangential to security policy. Ever since its inception, NATO has striven to promote the 'rationalisation, standardisation and inter-operability' of alliance weaponry. From this defence-industrial perspective, the alliance has made great strides over the past decade. For its part, the United States has undertaken a major reform of its technology-transfer bureaucracy, with the aim of promoting more transatlantic weapons collaboration. Alongside that development, the Europeans have engaged in a radical restructuring of their defence industries, making them bigger and more competitive. These changes suggest continuing efforts on each side of the Atlantic to maintain if not strengthen their security relationship."

Twenty-first century terrorism is gradually shifting away from direct state sponsorship and toward more amorphous groups, often having access to state resources but less and less likely to be under the control of the state itself. In an increasingly globalised environment, the traditional state-centric means of responding to terrorism will not be sufficient and may even be counterproductive. Thus, to be effective, American strategy must change fundamentally: the threat requires a flexible, broad-based globalised strategy, seamlessly incorporating international economic, political, legal, diplomatic, cultural and military elements. International terrorism is not dangerous because it can defeat the United States and its allies in a war, but because by marshalling unprecedented destructive power it can destroy the integrity of the state by undermining its ability to protect its citizens from direct attacks."

US-Russian relations are increasingly dynamic and US-European relations are increasingly strained. American and Russia have formed an unprecedented partnership. Their shared interest in combating global terrorism, and Putin's own pragmatic and more realistic foreign policy, have opened up new avenues for US-Russian cooperation. At a time when the United States and its traditional European allies are more and more divided over a range of economic and political issues - including complaints about American unilateralism and the conduct of the war on terrorism - America and Russia are increasingly in agreement. The US-Russian partnership has the potential to develop into a broader-based alliance that could ultimately have a positive impact both on Russia's domestic evolution and on European security."

Russia maintained its traditional dominance in its former southern provinces. China, as it developed its economic relations with the Central Asian countries, gradually increased its own political influence, while seeking to avoid confrontation with Moscow. The United States, despite its preoccupation with other areas of greater strategic significance, kept a wary eye on the region. After 11 September, this alignment of power has changed: the United States is now the region's main economic donor and security manager. The Bush administration needs to think clearly about the advantages and disadvantages of US dominance in Central Asia. The American presence in Central Asia threatens to offend Russian nationalistic sensibilities and make Putin's pro-US policy domestically very difficult. The optimal US approach to Central Asia is to establish leadership there in partnership with Russia. It is not in the American interest to corner Putin and deny him the opportunity to continue his policy of integrating Russia with the West."

Yet, in the long run, it is India and (perhaps less obviously) Iran - preeminent states in South Asia and the Gulf and natural status quo powers - that stand out as logical American partners. Iran may look like an unlikely partner, especially after US President George W. Bush's hard-line classification of the country, in his 30 January 2002 State of the Union address, as part of an 'axis of evil'. Yet, the American decision to renounce hopes for rapprochement with Iran - if that is indeed what has been decided - is misguided.

The amount of outside assistance necessary to alleviate human suffering and to manage nuclear fallout throughout the region would be staggering. Such a conflict would also have consequences well beyond the subcontinent. The nuclear taboo, which has been in place for over five decades, would be shattered. If one side prevails decisively, others may come to view nuclear weapons as 'normal weapons' that can be used successfully to achieve political goals. A nuclear war could lead to two failed states on the subcontinent, permanently traumatising societies and disrupting the broader geopolitical order in Asia. The remnants of nuclear infrastructure could then fall into the hands of rogue commanders or terrorists, raising the prospect of multiple, nuclear-armed Afghanistans. A new strategy to lessen these dangers carries risks, but the potential costs of inaction are much higher. If they fail to grapple with the problem, the United States and other leading states should not be surprised if nuclear deterrence in South Asia fails."

There is a growing and dangerous dynamic of interaction between the disease and warfare. AIDS threatens to weaken militaries, fragile state institutions and international peacekeeping, as well as creating demographic changes, all of which make war more likely. At the same time, the disease has a multiplier effect on conflicts' costs. War creates an environment in which the disease is not only more easily spread, but also in which the virus itself may morph and become even more dangerous. This mutual dynamic of a global disease, with violent political implications, strengthens the call for serious action."

In the post-11 September era, Washington has little patience for the FARC's bad faith at the negotiating table, growing involvement drug trafficking and increasingly brutal rural and urban activities. Yet, before the Bush administration decides to make any major moves in Colombia, it would do well to first incorporate lessons learned from Bill Clinton's Colombia policies, especially the vaunted $1.3 billion Plan Colombia programme.

Being a net oil-importer should, logically, bring China's interests closer to those of the oil-dependent West. In 1990, China abstained when the US mobilised an international coalition to drive Iraqi troops from Kuwait. A future crisis, after China has become a major importer, might elicit a more supportive stance. But the change to Chinese interests and orientations also poses challenges for the West: in effect, the industrialised oil-consuming countries of the US, Europe and North-east Asia must convince an ambitious, energy-hungry China that secure supply for all requires a cooperative foreign policy. So far, unfortunately, China is taking a different tack."

On closer inspection, the war on terrorism provides at best a very limited basis for US-PRC cooperation. Moreover, despite some superficial improvements in the diplomatic climate, none of the persistent, underlying sources of contention between the two powers has been significantly altered or alleviated by the current crisis. Finally, and most importantly, in ways that could not initially have been foreseen, the events of recent months may actually end up intensifying the ongoing Sino-American strategic rivalry. The forces impelling the United States and the PRC toward continuing suspicion and competition are powerful and deeply rooted in their very different domestic political regimes and in their positions in the international system. These competitive tendencies will not be easily offset or overcome, even by acts that all Americans and most Chinese acknowledge as crimes against humanity."

The Europeans in particular have reacted as much to American reactions to terrorism as they have to the terrorist threat itself. This puts the European Union in a difficult position; it must proceed with the daunting project of enlargement, based on the logic of peacetime prosperity and integration, in a new international context of crisis and renewed attention to national sovereignty. A conservative attachment to an unchanged NATO is not the answer, for NATO itself must adapt to a United States that is becoming more unilateralist, more militarist and less interested in its European alliance."

The common outcome was excessive government control over the use of capital. This provided initial strategic advantages and later vulnerabilities. Initially, governments were able to channel funds towards vital basic industries that were short of capital. But later, the same policies wasted capital on such a vast scale that whole sectors and whole banking systems risked collapse. The resulting regional crisis is crippling old leaders and opening opportunities for new ones. For the foreseeable future, China, a small and backward but decisively managed economy, is increasingly acknowledged within Asia as the region's leader - not loved, to some extent feared, but respected.

The failure to break through this stalemate has perpetuated a pattern of hostility, despite compelling common interests that were underscored by the 11 September crisis. It is time for not just a policy change but a paradigm shift. Washington should set aside any aspirations for wholesale engagement and official diplomatic relations, and instead focus on integrating Iran into the global economy and regional security order. This is the most promising means of encouraging Tehran to play a responsible role in the region.

They may hope to conquer their neighbours without risking intervention by outsiders. If the willingness of the US and others to stand up to nuclear-backed regional aggression were cast in doubt, nuclear proliferation would likely accelerate with painful global consequences. Thus, missile defences are needed to underwrite confidence that the US and its partners would continue to protect others against regional aggression. Further, such protectors have an overwhelming moral claim to defences to reduce their risks. Finally, the rest of the world need not worry that defences will turn the United States into an aggressive hegemon, for three reasons. First, practical defences will be far from perfect. Second, the rest of the world has the basic resources to contain the US if this somehow became necessary. And third, the United States' deep historical dedication to democracy renders it psychologically incapable of seeking to become the world's dictator."

Democracies face increasing constraints on the use of their overwhelming military might. Contemporary adversaries are undeterred or even inspired by Western superiority. To ensure that military power remains an effective national security instrument, Western civilian and military leaders need to pursue a discriminate force strategy. This will require a paradigm shift in thinking about, preparing for, threatening, or ultimately employing military power. Such a strategy requires innovation in Western doctrine, capabilities, force structure and coalition management. Using force discriminately will reinforce deterrence, bolster diplomatic efforts and increase the effectiveness of military action, should it become necessary."

After several months of speculation that he would make major changes in the size, forward deployments and basic nature of US military forces, he recognised that radical transformation was unwarranted. Indeed, in the end Rumsfeld produced what is surely the most cautious major defence review of the four that have been completed since the end of the Cold War. In most cases, Rumsfeld was right not to follow the advice of those advocating revolutionary reform, given the enduring importance of traditional defence missions and the technological impracticality of rapidly adopting a transformed force.

But the conditions under which pre-emption would be undertaken remain unclear. Military action against terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda, enjoys broad international legitimacy, but that consensus breaks down over the use of force against a state violating non-proliferation norms. A comparative analysis of historical cases reveals force to be as problematic as its non-military alternatives. Inadequate intelligence, concern over collateral damage to civilian populations and the fear of triggering a broader conflict have been major constraints on the use of force to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In the post-11 September era, pre-emption should be a rarely invoked policy option, and successful prevention strategies, employing non-military instruments, might forestall the need to resort to it."

The US-led 'war on terror', especially the use of armed force in Afghanistan, raises three questions. Is the law applicable to such operations? Should it be applied in situations different from what was envisaged in treaties? And are detainees 'prisoners of war'? A difficulty in applying the law is that governments usually view terrorists, like rebels in civil wars, as simply criminal. In the bombing in Afghanistan, the US has sought to observe the legal requirement of discrimination, but difficult issues are raised by the use of cluster bombs and the continued bombing after the Taliban regime's fall. As regards prisoners, US policy was ill-thought-out; and the perfectly justifiable classification of certain prisoners as 'unlawful combatants' should not mean that they are in a legal limbo. Treating the law cavalierly causes problems, especially for coalitions. The law, however imperfect, is irreplaceable."

Leadership means acting, and telling others how to act; it means taking the lead, sometimes alone, and recognising that others will come along once the course seems inevitable. Yet this particular concept contradicts every other theory of leadership in existence. Business-management literature can shed light on relations among states, for the best of this writing on leadership speaks to human nature. In a world where a nascent coalition of like-minded democracies is looking more and more like a true international community, states that aspire to global leadership will, increasingly, need to build consensus on the basis of a shared vision.

The 11 September attacks, ugly and deplorable as they were, brought an answer to the Afghans' prayers. At last, the only power capable of moving decisively against the Taliban and its supporters was forced to act. In the process, it had no choice but to engage the region more widely and deeply than it could have contemplated on 10 September. But if American policymakers expect to pull back from this engagement, limiting the US role to that of an 'over-the-horizon' actor, they should also expect further conflict and instability.

Smaller jurisdictions that previously relied on financial and tax piracy for revenues were finding themselves seriously threatened with exclusion from the global financial services system, and were taking at least statutory measures to change their systems. Jurisdictions such as the Channel Islands and the Bahamas radically restructured their trust and company laws to make anonymity more difficult, and Liechtenstein began to adopt EU-like customer identification rules. Securities markets were recognising their susceptibility to abuse and were initiating new controls and procedures. By the spring of 2002, however, the intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian and India-Pakistan conflicts had diverted attention from efforts to combat illicit finance schemes. As a result, Pakistan and most of the Gulf States have yet to undertake much of the hard work necessary to create functional anti money-laundering and terrorist-finance regulation and enforcement."
